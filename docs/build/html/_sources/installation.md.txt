# Installation
See below for instructions on how to download **pyInfinityFlow**. It must be installed on a system with Python>=3.8.

## Using Conda Virtual Environment - **RECOMMENDED**
It is best to use a virtual environment so that each of the dependencies can be installed correctly. First, download and install [conda]("https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html) on your machine if it is not already available.

After conda is installed, you can create a virtual environment with conda create and activate it with the conda activate command-line tool:
```
conda create --prefix /path/to/save/environment python=
```

## Using pip alone

## Using GitHub alone
Follow the below steps to download the most up-to-date version of the pyInfinityFlow package from GitHub. Create and/or move to the directory in which you want to install the package files. Then change directories into the package parent directory and install with pip:

```
cd directory_to_save_repository
git clone 
cd
pip install .
```
